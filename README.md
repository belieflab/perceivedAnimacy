# perceivedAnimacy

This code runs the Hallucinating Animacy experiment -- involving the identification of a wolf or a sheep.  To toggle between response types (e.g. whether participant is asked to report "wolf" vs. "sheep"), go to the exp/params.js file, and change expt_name to either "wolf" or "sheep".  You can then proceed to run the expt.html file on the server.

To run the wolf version, you can also use the exptW.html file.
To run the sheep version, you can also use the exptS.html file.

This experiment should take around 16 minutes.

The full experiment contains 50 "chase" trials, and 50 "no-chase" trials.
