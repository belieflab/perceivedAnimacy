Feel free to dim the lights as well.</p><p>Close the door or do whatever is necessary to minimize disturbance during the experiment.  Please also take a moment to silence your phone so that you are not interrupted by any messages mid-experiment.</p><p>Throughout this experiment, you will see greyed out text as in the last line below.</p><p>And a quick note: This text will contain the instructions for how to move to the next page -- which will typically involve pressing the spacebar.  You will not be able to press the spacebar until after a brief period of time has elapsed.  Please use that time to read the instructions on the given page.
