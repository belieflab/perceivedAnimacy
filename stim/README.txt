"chasing" and "mirrorChasing" are the original videos from van Buren
These folders were remove because the repository it is very large. The original
videos can be found in the van Buren paper or requested to me.

"chasing2" and "mirrorChasing2" are the videos with an extra black frame 
at the end. Those videos were created in MATLAB code "addBlackFrame.m".
