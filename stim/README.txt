"chasing" and "mirrorChasing" are the original videos from van Buren
These folders were remove because the repository it is very large. The original
videos can be found in "chasing_detection_stimuli.zip" provided by Benjamin 
van Buren (van Buren, Gao & Scholl, 2017).

"chasing2" and "mirrorChasing2" are the videos with an extra black frame 
at the end. Those videos were created in MATLAB code "addBlackFrame.m".
