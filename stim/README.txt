"chasing" and "mirror_chasing" are the original videos from Benjamin van Buren and
are found inside folder "van_Buren_stimuli". Inside you will find the original
videos in the zip folder "chasing_detection_stimuli.zip" provided by Benjamin 
van Buren (van Buren, Gao & Scholl, 2017).

"chasing2" and "mirrorChasing2" are the videos with an extra black frame 
at the end. Those videos were created in MATLAB code "addBlackFrame.m".
